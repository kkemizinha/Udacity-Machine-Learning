# Udacity-Machine-Learning

The main goal of the project is to explore a dataset with financial and email data
from the Enron company, identifying frauds. Machine learning can help on this matter, by
applying its techniques to develop a classifier to identify the people who were involved
with the fraud.
The dataset is made up of employees' financial attributes and e-mails exchanged
between
them, plus an indicator if the person was involved in the fraud. The
presented problem has defined classes (if the person is involved or not), and we can
apply a supervised classifier to find patterns in the data and to classify the people
according to the identified standards
